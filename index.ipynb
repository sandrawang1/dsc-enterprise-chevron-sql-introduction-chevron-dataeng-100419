    "# SQL and Relational Databases - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn about SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language. It has been around since the 1970s and there are many different dialects of the language including MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL, to name a few. Each of these has particularities such as specific functions or keywords for that specific implementation. All of these, however, have the same basic structures including keywords like `SELECT`, and the same general database architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Structure of SQL Databases \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases are the root container for data. Databases are a collection of tables. Each table is similar to a csv-file or a spreadsheet within an Excel workbook. That is, tables are two-dimensional objects with specific columns and associated entries organized into rows. To demonstrate, here is an outline of a database structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Database-Schema.png\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram, each rectangle is a table, with the table name listed at the top. In this case, we have 8 tables: productlines, products, orderdetails, employees, offices, customers, orders, and payments. Below each of the table names, we have a list of the various column names associated with that table. So for example, the productlines table has four columns: productLine, textDescription, htmlDescription and image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Data\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is designed to work with **relational data**. This really just means pieces of data that are related to eachother. In the example above, data on the employees table has some relationship to data on the offices table, indicating that an employee may be associated with a specific office location. Likewise, certain orders are associated with certain customers. Lots of real world data is inherently related. Students have an association to a course, ingredients are related to a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also note that some of these column names are preceded by an asterix (\\*). This indicates that this is the **primary key** for the table. A primary key is a unique identifier for a table. That is, there can only be unique values for this column entry. lastName would not be a good choice for a primary key as it's common for people to have the same last names or even firstName + lastName pairings.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely you'll see that the columns that are the primary key one on table can also appear on other tables. This is known as a **foreign key** aka the primary key from a different (\"foreign\") table. This is the core idea of how data on different tables is associated in a relational database. If you were told a specific customerNumber, and then given a list of order data that included the customerNumber, you could determine which orders were placed by that customer by matching up the primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines, circles, arrows, and tick marks are showing different categorizations on exactly how this data is linked. You'll learn much more about these relationships later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connect to SQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Your initial primary use case of SQL will be querying data stored within databases. To do this, you connect to the database with some sort of tool. This could be via Python, as you'll see in the next lesson, the command line, or a GUI tool such as SQLWorkbench. Once you're connected to the database, you can then read and select data from the database, or even write data to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Querying Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve data from one or more tables you usually use a `SELECT` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple query would look something like this:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT col1, col2, col3\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "WHERE records match criteria\n",
    "LIMIT 100;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another similar query to preview all of the columns from the first 5 rows of a table would look like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how all of these statements start with the `SELECT` clause, followed by what you want to select. If selecting multiple columns, you separate them with a comma. Then you specify where that data is being retrieved from the using the `FROM` clause followed by the table name. Afterward, you can provide conditions such as filters or sorting. To demonstrate, here's a more complex example where you could preview the 10 most expensive payments received.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM payments\n",
    "ORDER BY amount DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice all the keywords in SQL appear bolded and in green. Although not required, all the code here also has capitalized all of the keywords to make them stand out further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you got a quick overview of what SQL is, and saw a few of your first SQL queries! Remember that there are multiple SQL dialects all with particular differences, but the overall language is generally fairly similar and interchangeable."
